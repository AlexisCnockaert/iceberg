The loaded code of a repository can have three different shapes:
- Nothing is loaded yet (represented by an instance of me).
- All loaded packages using versions from the same commit (should be the most common situation).
- You cherry-picked versions comming from differents commits (not recomended but supported).

This superclass is just for organization purposes.
